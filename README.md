# CSCI-4210_CPUSimulation
RPI CSCI-4210 CPU simulation project.

Simulated Shortest Job First(SJF), Shortest Remaining Time(SRT), First Come First Server(FCFS), and Round Robin(RR) scheduling algorithms accounting for context switch and a pseudo random list of CPU burst time. Although I/O bursts were considered in the time calculation, no further considerations were made to mimic it to the actual behavior of the CPU. 

The simulation analysis results may be found in the simout.txt file.
